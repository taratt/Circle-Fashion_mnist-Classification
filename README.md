# Circle-Fashion_mnist-Classification
This project attempts to classify circles made by sklearn.datasets make_circles in the first part and fashion_mnist dataset's images in the second part using Neural Networks.
(Detailed report for this project can be viewed in the jupyter notebook uploaded to the repository)
## Part I
In this part different activation functions and loss functions are tested to find out which ones give the best results and accuracy and loss measures are plotted accordingly. Multiple general guidelines and thumbrules are tested in this part (Detailed report can be viewed in the jupyter notebook of the project). Also different neural network architectures are implemented and hyperparameter tuning is done (especially for the learning rate) to achieve the best results.

## Part II
In this section, at first normalization is done for the grayscale amounts of pixels of fashion_mnist dataset's images. Secondly different neural network architectures, hyperparameters and optimezers are tested and tuned in order to classify the images with greater accuracy. In the end, the confusion matrix is plotted to visualize the results.
